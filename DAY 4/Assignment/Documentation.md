# Assignment Day 4

## Generative Art

The objective is to create custom images, using which a generative pattern is created in a 10Print Grid.
Another aspect to this is to create the custom images so it's seamless and look continuos while the pattern is generated.

### My Images

My idea was to create a jungle vine pattern. So my individual images are parts of a jungle vine.

The problem with the images i created was it was not seamless, meaning the edges are not continuos so the illusion of seamless pattern is broken.
