# Week 1 Weekend Assignment

## Lone Samurai and her pet

### Narrative

There lived a young samurai, in a small hut with her pet, a calf.
One day the calf runs away from their home. The samurai has to go find the calf and bring the calf back before it's night.

### Characters

Young Samurai

Calf

### Interactions
I plan on making the characters animated using sprites but they will be mostly stationary in the centre of the screen but playing the movement animation.
Whenever the user gives inputs for movements, the background will be moved instead of the characters giving the illusion of the character moving forward through the landscape. The background is a long extended image that moves with user inputs(left and right arrows).

The idea is to create an experience for the user to get a feeling of traversing and exploration also anticipation on whats coming next.

The user will press any key to start, when that happens, the calf runs away to the other end of the background. It'll stay at a particular tree at the near the other end of the background image, and im planning the samurai has to perform an action when she reaches near her pet, which then makes the calf follow her back to the hut. The calf will be controlled with the same inputs for the samurai during this stage. So it'll feel like the calf is following the samurai.

When the experience starts, the scene will get darker gradually with time, so like day turning to night. The user has to bring calf back home before its totally night. If its totally night, the user cannot see anything because screen will turn pitch black and in the story, they're considered as getting lost while coming back at night.

*important!* Please zoom out the browser window(67% works, please tweak it till the scale of everthing looks bcorrect) because there's some problem with the scale of the backgroung image now, i have to fix it.

### Challenges faced while coding

Moving the background instead of the character.

Trying to get both the sprites to work together with and without inputs.

Turning to night.

## Learnings

Working with just Functions is getting tedious and confusing because of the large number of variables.

More efficient way would be using different classes and objects for the elements such as samurai sprite, calf sprite and background image.
