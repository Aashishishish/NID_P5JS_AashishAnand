# Assignment Day 2

## Peace to Love

The objective of the assignment is to turn the day one composition into a another feeling through animations or other mouse inputs.

### Recalling day 1

My day 1 assignment composition consisted of 3 flower like forms, two small ones at each side and one bigger form in the centre. This was my representation of peace. The overall compostion felt less like flowers and it gave the feeling of clarity, harmony and peace as per the concept.
The colour template for this was colours which were easy for the eyes, mild and soft. Light Blue, Light yellow, pastel pink.

### Transitioning from Peace to Love

The idea was to bring a dramatic transition to the previous composition. Bring in movement, colour palette changes.

The idea i had in mind was- The bigger form in the centre between the two smaller forms will erupt in a dramatic red/orange/pink shades, represeting a feeling of love erupting between them. 
The Smalller forms on either side will move towards each other till the centre, where they becomes one.

The central red/orange/pink eruption will keep breathing like how love has it's ups and downs.
